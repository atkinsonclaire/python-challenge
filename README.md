In PyBank, I was given the financial data of the company I worked for and was told to use Python to pull summary information of the dataset that I have been given. It includes:
    -- the number of months recorded in the dataset
    -- the net total of amount of Profits/Losses during the time period
    -- the average change of Profit/Losses throughout the time period
    -- the greatest increase in profits (when and amount)
    -- the greatest decrease in losses (when and amount)

In PyPoll, I was given a dataset of voting results from a small town and was told to analyze the votes in a local election. Using Python, I calculated:
    -- the total number of votes casted in the election
    -- the candidates who received votes
    -- the percentage of votes each candidate won
    -- the total number of votes each candidate won
    -- the election winner
