# PyBank

In the PyBank folder, I created a Python script that analyzed the financial records of your company. It includes a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.

My Python script analyzes the records to calculate each of the following: the total number of months included in the dataset, the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, the average of the "Profit/Losses" changes over the entire period, the greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period, and the greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.


# PyPoll

In the PyPoll folder, I developped a Python script geared to helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process. It includes a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. 

My Python script analyzes the voter records and calculates each of the following: the total number of votes cast, a complete list of candidates who received votes, the percentage of votes each candidate won, the total number of votes each candidate won, and the winner of the election based on popular vote.
